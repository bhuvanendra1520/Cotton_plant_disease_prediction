Every nation's economy depends heavily on agriculture, and India is recognised as an agro-based country. To produce healthy crops free of disease is one of agriculture's primary goals. Cotton is one of the most economically significant agricultural crops and is grown in the majority of the world. Due to its tropical cultivation, it is susceptible to a variety of agricultural pests and diseases, and effective treatments are needed. Furthermore, it can be challenging for producers to correctly identify lesions because the early stages of the main pests and diseases' symptoms make it impossible to distinguish between them. The current research offers a deep learning-based remedy for screening cotton leaves, which makes it possible to monitor the health of the cotton crop and make smarter management decisions.
